The wheels from this ICE had a "new design". On the 2nd of June 1991, the ICE
project is launched. One of the aims of the cutting edge project is to reach
a new standard in luxury and ride quality for its passengers. The train has
steel solid wheels known as monoblock wheels but Deutsche Bahn, the company that runs the ICE soon experiences problems with them:

> "Shortly after the trains went into service they found that they had a
technical problem: the wheels were wearing in a strange pattern.
When this happened, especially when the trains were traveling at high speed,
noise and vibration would be generated and transmitted up into the passenger
car." @documentary:seconds_from_disaster

The carriage where this was the most evident was the restaurant car where
the plates were shaking and the glasses were spilling.

The problem of vibrations and noise seriously affected the ICE's reputation for comfort. Within two months of the ICE's prestigious launch, under pressure to
find a solution, Deutsche Bahn decided to replace its original monoblock wheels
with duoblock wheels.

### Duoblock wheel

Tranditional monoblock or one-piece wheel is made from a
single solid piece of steel but a duoblock or two-piece wheel has an inner
wheel surrounded by an outer rim. Sandwiched between are sections of rubber
designed to help absorb vibrations and provide a smoother ride. On the 31st of
August 1992 Deutsche Bahn approves the duoblocked wheel type 064 for use on
its ICE trains. The new wheel instantly improves the ride and cups and sauces
no longer shake and rattle in the dining car.

### Metal fatigue

The wheel rim fractured thorough a metal fatigue. Fatigue occurs when a movement
is repeated over and over again causing a stress break at a weak point in the
metal. A wheel on a train actually flexes slightly as it turns because of the
massive load it's under supporting the moving train. These movements are
miniscule but the constant flexing of the metal can eventually, given enough
usage, cause the wheels destruction through metal fatigue. With a duoblock
wheel there is a layer of rubber between the wheel and the rim. The soft rubber
allows the outer rim to flex much more than on a monoblock wheel. As the
separate rim wears down through use the flexing increases. Without a thorough
inspection the wheel rim can become too thin and a small defect can become a
crack that eventually fractures causing the outer rim to break away from the
inner wheel with devastating results. Metal fatigue fractures in train wheels
usually develop over the period of months or years.

### Inadequate testing of the wheels by Deutsche Bahn

After the accident, the rim from the wheel in question
is taken to the The Fraunhofer Institute for Structural Durability and System
Reliability (LBF) in Darmstadt, Germany for forensic testing.

> "We studied press releases from the District Attorney's office
(Staatsanwaltschaft Lüneburg) and the Deutsche Bahn AG, both of which contained
comments and expert testimonies. The Fraunhofer Institute LBF Darmstadt (sister
of the FHG-IZfP, Fraunhofer's NDT Institute Saarbrücken) presented 300 pages of expert testimony and another 300 pages of literature references.

> A cracking inside the ring of the wheel was responsible. There was no
indication of material or production failure. This crack was caused by excessive
load and wear. When ICE began operations, there was no certification in place
that would document appropriate design and reliability. Moreover no fracture
mechanic calculation was done that could prove the strength of the wheel during
its lifetime. According to the experts such wheels should not be operated at
less than 880 mm diameter (new condition = 920 mm), subject to annual testing
for inner and middle zone cracks. (An important NDT fact!) The diameter of the
accident wheel was 862 mm. The limit set by Deutsche Bahn is 854 mm.

> We interviewed District Attorney Jürgen Wigger, who explained that the wheel
in question was first put into operation in 1994 and ran 1,8 Mill km until the
accident in June 1998. In terms of assessing responsibility for the accident, it
is significant that during its 4 years of operation, the wheel was never tested." @website:ndtnet

> "Findings released by the Fraunhofer Institute suggest that poor design and
insufficient testing were to blame for the accident. The rubber cushioned wheels,
which had been used successfully on streetcars, were not suitable for the heavier
load of ICE trains operating at much higher speeds. At the time, Germany did not
have the facilities to adequately test such designs, so many of the wheel design
decisions were based on analysis and theory rather than test data. The limited
testing that was done did not account for the dynamic, repetitive forces that
result from extended wear, extreme loads, and high speed operation." @nasa:safety_message:derailed

The answer given to the investigation team by Deutsche Bahn: instead of relying
on a special metal fatigue detection equipment it turns out that the engineers
at Deutsche Bahn's Munich maintenance facility had been carrying out safety
checks on ICE's wheels with "nothing more advanced than a flashlight".

> "The use of torches will only pick out the largest and most dangerous of
cracks. It won't pick out tiny fatigue cracks at an early stage of their life.
In terms of detecting potential cracks on the inner side of the rim of
a dual block wheel is completely useless technique." @documentary:seconds_from_disaster

The engineers at Deutsche Bahn's Munich Depot had also been carrying out some
tests with their high-tech testing machines but the data was considered
unreliable as the equipment constantly came up with the error messages ("false
positives").

> The workshop where the inspection was done was equipped with ultrasonic equipment to check the wheels for cracks. There, the train rode through a measurement setup at 6 km/h. In principle, this equipment permitted discovery of cracks not visible to the eye because a surface fracture would reflect sound. However, this equipment was unsound for two reasons. First, it could only detect cracks in the tread. It could not detect cracks arising from within, a distinct pos- sibility certainly given the second mechanism explained above. Worse was that the equipment was so sensitive that in addition to raising an alarm when it found cracks, it also did this for innocuous surface irregularities. That resulted in nearly 20% of the tested wheels falling in the “needs replacing” category. That was impossible given the time pressure in the workshop. That is why the wheels were tested the old-fashioned way: by eye (with a lamp) and ear. This last method consisted in hitting the wheel with a hammer and assessing the sound of the wheel. However, it is unlikely that this method, often used on block-cast wheels, was suitable for this type. The rubber ring against which it is pressed muffles the vibrations in the steel tire. One obvious conclusion is that no suitable testing equipment was present.

In the week leading up to the Eschede train crash the wheel that would have
become the cause of the accident was highlighted as being defective in three
separate automated checks.

### Flawed problem reporting process

The maintenance reports from the crashed
train's onboard computer contained reports of two months before the crash: the
conductors and other train staff large as many as eight separate complaints
about the unusual noise and vibration coming from the bogie that carries the
defective wheel. Deutsche Bahn didn't replace the wheel.

Monoblock wheels have been in use for 40 years but Deutsche Bahn's duoblock
wheel is of a new design and has never been used on a high-speed train before.
In fact, the duoblock wheels are traditionally found on one of the slowest
moving forms of rail transport: the tram. In July 1997 almost a year before
the Eschede train crash the company that runs the tram network in the German
city of Hannover discovers dangerous metal fatigue cracks occuring in its
duoblock wheels, even though they are running at speeds of only 24 kmph. They
decide to change the duoblock wheels well more often before metal fatigue has
a chance to develop. The train company contracts the other rail operators
running on the duoblock wheels to inform them of the metal fatigue problem and
it's simple solution. In Autumn 1997 only months before the accident they
notified Deutsche Bahn. According to the tram company, Deutsche Bahn said they
haven't experienced any problems with metal fatigue.

> "It was revealed later that the institute had told the DB management as early as 1992 about its concerns about possible wheel-tyre failure.

> It was soon apparent that dynamic repetitive forces had not been accounted for in the statistical failure modelling done during the design phase, and the resulting design lacked an adequate margin of safety. The following factors, overlooked during design, were noted:

> 1. The tyres were flattened into an ellipse as the wheel turned through each revolution (approximately 500,000 times during a typical day in service on an ICE train), with corresponding fatigue effects.
> 2. In contrast to the monobloc wheel design, cracks could also form on the inside of the tyre.
> 3. As the tyre became thinner due to wear, the dynamic forces were exaggerated, resulting in crack growth.
> 4. Flat spots and ridges or swells in the tyre dramatically increased the dynamic forces on the assembly and greatly accelerated wear." [@wikipedia:en:eschede; @documentary:seconds_from_disaster]
