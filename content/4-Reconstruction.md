## Reconstruction

### Wheel fracture

"About 130 kilometres (80 mi) and forty minutes away from Hamburg and six
kilometres (3.7 mi) south of central Eschede, near Celle, the steel tyre (wheel
rim) on a wheel on the third axle of the first car broke, peeled away from the
wheel, and punctured the floor of the car, where it remained embedded." @wikipedia:en:eschede

The train traveled over 3 km before derailing.

### Checkrail and derailment

ICE traveling at 200kmph with the wheel rim scraping along the track.
As the train runs over the first set of points, the end of the rim scoops up the
checkrail which smashes through the floor of coach 1. It is this massive
impact that causes two of the wheels of the coach 1 to derail. At this
point ICE has derailed but this alone is not enough yet to cause the accident.

After passing two set points ICE actually starts
traveling on two different sets of tracks: the main line and the branch line.
As ICE passes over the second set of points, one of the two derailed wheels of
coach 1 smashes into them and forces them to open. This means that the carriages
following coach 1 are now guided on to the wrong track: the local branch line
rather than the main line. With the front power car still pulling at 200kmph but
the coaches behind it slowing as they leave the main line and derail, the
connection between the power car and the rest of the train tears apart.

At this point emergency air brakes deploy automatically deploy throughout the
train. 1.5 seconds before crash ICE is derailed but essentially undamaged and
its emergency brakes could bring the train to a controlled stop but that's not
what happens: the compact nature of the wreckage indicates to investigators that
this is a particularly violent accident.

> "As the train passed over the first of two points, the embedded tyre slammed against the guide rail of the points, pulling it from the railway ties. This guide rail also penetrated the floor of the car, becoming embedded in the vehicle and lifting the axle carriage off the rails. At 10:59 local time (08:59 UTC), one of the now-derailed wheels struck the points lever of the second switch, changing its setting. The rear axles of car number 3 were switched onto a parallel track, and the entire car was thereby thrown into the piers supporting a 300-tonne (300-long-ton; 330-short-ton) roadway overpass, destroying them. @wikipedia:en:eschede

### Bridge collapse

The bridge is supported by concrete pillars which stand about two meters from
the tracks. The power car and coaches one and two pass under the bridge without
touching it. But coach 3 is pushed outwards by the momentum of the train and
slams directly into the pillars: ICE crashes into the Eschede road bridge.

> "The third card was diverted over to the siding and swung out to the right and
at that time struct the supports for the bridge and knocked the supports out
from under the bridge." @documentary:seconds_from_disaster

> "Car number 4, likewise derailed by the violent deviation of car number 3 and still travelling at 200 kilometres per hour (125 mph), passed intact under the bridge and rolled onto the embankment immediately behind it, striking several trees before coming to a stop. Two Deutsche Bahn railway workers who had been working near the bridge were killed instantly when the derailed car crushed them. The breaking of the car couplings caused the automatic emergency brakes to engage and the mostly undamaged first three cars came to a stop." @wikipedia:en:eschede

When coach 3 destroys the pillars, the bridge starts to collapse. Couch 4 clears
the falling bridge but catapults off the track and crashes into nearby trees.
As coach 5 passes under the collapsing bridge, it is struck by tons of falling
concrete and the rear half is totally destroyed.

> "The rear axles of the third coach were switched onto a parallel track, twisting the coach perpendicular to the rails, and sending the car careening into the pylons of a
300 metric ton roadway overpass just beyond the second switch. Coach four, derailed by the violent deviation of car three, traveled underneath the bridge impacting an embankment, and killing three railway employees who were working nearby." @nasa:safety_message:derailed

The restaurant coach is crushed to a height of 15 centimeters by the falling
bridge. The resulting debris now blocks the path of the remaining six coaches
and the rear power coach which are moving in almost 200kmph concertina into the
rage ([Figure @fig:bridge_concertina_tape]).

> "Coach five passed under the weakened bridge as it collapsed, crushing the car completely. The remaining coaches, including the service car, restaurant car, three first-class cars, and the rear locomotive, jackknifed into the collapsed bridge in a zigzag pattern." @nasa:safety_message:derailed

### Rescue efforts

> "By 11:07 AM, only 37 minutes after the WCR left Hanover Station, the police declared a “major emergency” and dispatched rescue teams. Over 1,000 rescue workers descended on the accident site. Despite their efforts, 101 people lost their lives and 88 more were seriously injured in the mishap. The derailment at Eschede was Germany’s worst train accident since World War II.

> During the rescue effort, emergency workers found it difficult to remove victims from the wreckage because of pressure resistant windows and the railcar’s rigid aluminum frames. The Deutsche Bahn replaced these windows with a new design that included predetermined breaking points to allow for easier access to trapped passengers." @nasa:safety_message:derailed
