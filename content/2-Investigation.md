## Investigation

> "Remains of a VW Golf Variant, belonging to the two railway workers killed in the crash, were found beneath the debris of the crashed ICE. Media first speculated that the train had derailed after a collision with the car, a circumstance that caused a train to jackknife in the Ufton Nervet rail crash six years later; this theory was quickly dismissed, however, as the front power car did not receive any damage at all, having continued to coast down the track until it passed the next station." @wikipedia:en:eschede

Investigators explore the wreck train: damage to the compartment, where JÃ¶rg
Dittmann was travelling, indicates where the wheel rim unraveled, splitting the
floor open and piercing the armrest.

Investigators find that one of the checkrails, a length of steel, is missing.
It is been completely torn away from the track. Only a few meters away from the
compartment, in the corridor, investigators find the missing checkrail that left
gaping wholes in the floor and ceiling.
