  This gray paper is a result of a private research done by the author in order
  to understand the causes of Eschede Catastrophe.

  The research is based on the number of sources including:

  \- "Eschede train disaster", the episode from "Seconds from
  Disaster" documentary television programme (2004)

  \- Wikipedia article "Eschede derailment", English and German versions

  \- NASA System Failure Case Study - "Derailed" (2007)

  \- NASA Safety Message - "Eschede Train Disaster" (2007)

  \- Paper "Case Description: The ICE Train Accident near Eschede" by Michiel Brumsen (2011).

  While each of these sources is a good overview by itself, the author believes
  that learning from all of them yields a more complete picture of
  the Eschede accident. In particular, the "Eschede train disaster" documentary
  film contains video simulations, that illustrate step by step what has
  happened, the level of detail that the other sources are missing.

  The text is based on the narration from "Eschede train disaster" film and
  also contains quotations from Wikipedia pages, "Derailed" NASA System Failure
  Case Study, "Case Description: The ICE Train Accident near Eschede" paper and
  some others.

  **Disclaimer**: This paper is only a compilation - it does not add any
  new information compared to what has been written before. It is not a
  replacement for all or any of the abovementioned sources. The reader is
  encouraged to read the official documents when looking for a reliable
  information.
