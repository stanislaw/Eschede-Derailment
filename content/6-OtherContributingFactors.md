### Emergency brake visibility

Dittmann could not find an emergency brake in the corridor and had not noticed
that there was an emergency brake handle in his own compartment.

### The track’s design

> "In many other countries where high-speed trains are used – France for instance – these run on specially built tracks. This has several advantages: The faster the train’s speed, the straighter, flatter and more stable the track has to be. Older tracks often do not satisfy these requirements. Moreover, fewer switches and crossings are needed because tracks are seldom if ever shared with other lines. Tunnels are often placed at road crossings.

> The tracks for ICE trains were, and are, mixed. The ICE trains ride over normal tracks shared with other types of trains as well as on special high-speed tracks. The route near Eschede was not a special high-speed track; there were four track lines. The ICE trains rode on the innermost two tracks. However, other trains also used these tracks; that is why it was necessary to be able to move trains from the innermost to the outermost tracks and back. This track design played a large role in the accident near Eschede. The switch whose frog the broken steal tyre tore off and where the wheel derailed lay just 300 meter before the viaduct. The switch that the derailed wheel turned lay only 120 meter before the viaduct. It should be clear that if there had been no switches to the adjacent track, the accident would not have taken on the grave proportions that it did. On 21 December 1993, a TGV train on France’s Paris-Lille line derailed at 300 km/h. Only two people received slight injuries. The train did run off the track, but nothing much else happened even though the train jolted on a few kilometres alongside the rails before it came to a halt. A similar accident with the TGV occurred in 2001, again without fatalities and just a few wounded. Comparisons between this and the accident at Eschede regularly point to the more rigid couplings between the carriages that we mentioned above." @book:article:brumsen
