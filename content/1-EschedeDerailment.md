## Overview

> "The Eschede derailment occurred on 3 June 1998, near the village of Eschede in
the Celle district of Lower Saxony, Germany, when a high-speed train derailed
and crashed into a road bridge. 101 people were killed and around 100 were
injured. It remains the worst rail disaster in the history of the Federal
Republic of Germany and the worst high-speed-rail disaster worldwide. The cause
was a single fatigue crack in one wheel that, when it failed, caused the train
to derail at a set of points and crash into the pillars of a concrete road
bridge, causing it to collapse and crush two coaches. The remaining coaches and rear power car crashed into the wreckage." @wikipedia:en:eschede

Bridge at 125mphs. A huge metal shard creates a gaping hole in the carriage

Jörg Dittmann takes immediate action: takes his wife and son out of the damaged
coach and leaves the damaged coach to alert the train crew to what he has just
wittnessed. He finds a train conductor in the 3rd coach.

Conductor tells Jörg Dittmann  that according to the company rules he must
investigate the incident before he is authorized to activate the emergency
brakes.

Jörg Dittmann leads him back to inspect the damage, it takes 1 minute to get
there.

10:58, As Jörg Dittmann and the conductor are moving, the train starts to sway.
Jörg Dittmann is trying to persuade conductor to stop the train:

> "Even when the train started to sway about he didn't show any signs of
willigness to pull the emergency brake, he just wanted to find what was wrong...
we came to the first coach where we had been sitting and I was just about
to point to the spot and show him the damage and that's when it happened..."
